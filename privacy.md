# CustomEffects Privacy Policy
Custom(Profile)Effects doesn't save anything else than your Discord User ID and the Effect you requested.
Everyone on Discord can access your ID. Check [this][idpost] post by Discord if you don't know what a Discord User ID is.

- If you want to remove your **Custom Effect** by **YOU**, please contact our Team in our [Discord Server][server].
- If you want to remove **an effect** from **your profile**, please contact our Team in our [Discord Server][server].
- Both of the removals will remove your user id and effect from your profile and our [database][db]. 
- Removing your user id will literally just remove the effect from your profile and our [database][db].
